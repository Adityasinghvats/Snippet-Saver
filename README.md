# Snippet-Saver

Snippet-saver is a vscode extension tool, which relies on local storage of your device to provide create, read and delete functionality for code snippets. I have made this extension because I don't trust anyone with my code files and want to keep it in my local machine and I believe you should not trust anyone else for your personal data as well.

## Features
- Open-Source, you can build it directly from the Github repository.

## Requirements

## Release Notes

- Version 1.0.0 -> Initial release with important functionality working.

### v1.0.0

- Initial release of snippet-saver.
### TL;DR
- I won't be adding any functionality which depends on a LLM or any external APIs, as it will be against my product policy of preserving privacy.
